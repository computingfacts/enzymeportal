# EMBL-EBI Enzyme Portal

[Enzyme Portal](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enzymeportal/) integrates publicly available information about enzymes, such as reaction mechanism, small-molecule chemistry, biochemical pathways and drug compounds.

The Enzyme Portal is for those interested in the biology of enzymes and proteins with enzymatic activity. It integrates publicly available information about enzymes, such as small-molecule chemistry, biochemical pathways and drug compounds. It provides a concise summary of information from:

* UniProt Knowledgebase
* Protein Data Bank in Europe
* Rhea, a database of enzyme-catalyzed reactions
* Reactome, a database of biochemical pathways
* M-CSA, a database of enzyme reaction mechanisms
* IntEnz, a resource with enzyme nomenclature information
* OMIM, An Online Catalog of Human Genes and Genetic Disorders.
* ChEBI and ChEMBL, which contain information about small molecule chemistry and bioactivity

The Enzyme Portal brings together lots of diverse information about enzymes and displays it in an organized overview. It covers a large number of species including the key model organisms, and provides a simple way to compare orthologs.
